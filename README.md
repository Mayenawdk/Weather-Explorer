# Weather Dashboard ☁️🌦️

## Overview
Welcome to my **Weather Dashboard**! 🌤️ This app gives you up-to-the-minute weather data for any city you search for, plus a 5-day forecast. Whether you're planning your next trip or just curious about the weather, this dashboard has got you covered. It uses the OpenWeather API to fetch real-time data and keeps track of all your recent searches.

## Why I Built This
I wanted to create a useful tool for travelers, or anyone who just wants a fast way to check the weather for different cities. This project challenged me to connect to an external API, manage user inputs, and save data in localStorage—all while keeping the app's design clean and functional. Plus, I love creating things that are both useful and intuitive. 

## Features
- **Search for any city** and get its current weather 🌡️.
- **5-day forecast** showing temperature, wind speed, and humidity for each day 📅.
- **Search history** stored and clickable for quick access 🔁.
- Clean, user-friendly interface—exactly how I like it ✨.

## How It Works
1. Enter a city name in the search bar.
2. Click **Search** to see the current weather conditions for that city.
3. Your search history is saved and displayed on the left side for easy access.
4. View the 5-day forecast and plan your days ahead with confidence!

## Tech Stack
- **HTML** & **CSS**: For structuring and styling the dashboard.
- **JavaScript**: For handling all the logic, including fetching data from the API.
- **OpenWeather API**: To get real-time weather data.
- **LocalStorage**: For saving and displaying recent searches.

## Deployed App
You can try the live app here: [Weather Dashboard Live](#) (Update with your URL after deployment)

## Installation & Setup
If you want to run the app locally:
1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Weather-Dashboard.git`
2. Navigate to the project folder: `cd Weather-Dashboard`
3. Open **index.html** in your browser, and you're all set.

## Future Enhancements
- Add error handling for cities that don’t exist (because typos happen).
- Include more detailed weather data like sunrise/sunset times and UV index.
- Implement a toggle for switching between Celsius and Fahrenheit 🔄.

## Acknowledgements
Big thanks to the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/) for providing such a rich and comprehensive dataset. And of course, a shout-out to myself for staying focused on building this project 😎.
